Personal flight log for paragliding pilots. Written with
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) / [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) in
the backend and Bulma CSS / SvelteKit in the frontend.

This software is mostly aimed at pilots that track their flights using a GPS
tracker which generates IGC files, but it can also be used without an IGC file
for every flight.

The IGC file is stored together with the flight data. Every flight can be
linked to an [XContest](https://www.xcontest.org/) upload.

A free hosted version of the flight book can be found at
[flugbuech.bargen.dev](https://flugbuech.bargen.dev/). Registration is open!

If you have any question, you can contact me at
[flugbuech@bargen.dev](mailto:flugbuech@bargen.dev).


## Status

### What works

- [x] User registration / login / authentication
- [x] Adding flights manually to the database
- [x] Simple submission of of flights by uploading IGC file (all
  relevant flight data like launch time/location, landing time/location,
  duration, distance, etc can be extracted from that file)
- [x] Manage locations
- [x] Show stats about the past flights

### What's not yet implemented

- [ ] Password recovery
- [ ] Map with all your flights
- [ ] Make it easier to self-host
- [ ] Import launch / landing locations from a public database
- [ ] Direct upload to XContest


## Setup

Requirements:

- Rust stable (see `rust-toolchain` file)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- For building the frontend components: nodejs / npm
- For production environments: A reverse proxy like Nginx

Install `diesel_cli`:

    cargo install -f diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres

Start PostGIS database:

    docker run -d --name flugbuech-pg \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=flugbuech \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=flugbuech \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=flugbuech-dev-password \
      -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
      docker.io/postgis/postgis:15-3.4-alpine

Prepare database and run migrations:

    diesel setup

(Note: You can also apply migrations by starting with the `--migrate` flag)

Install frontend dependencies:

    (cd frontend && npm install)

You're set up! To start the development API server:

    cargo run

And to run the development frontend server in a second terminal window:

    cd frontend && npm run dev

Then go to <http://localhost:5173/> to view the local application.


## Creating test users

Head to <http://localhost:5173/auth/registration> and sign up regularly.


## Testing

First, set up a test database:

    docker exec flugbuech-pg createdb -U flugbuech flugbuech_test

Run backend tests:

    cargo test

To run frontend tests:

    cd frontend
    npm run test


## Resetting Password

To reset a password directly in the database:

    UPDATE users
    SET password = crypt('newpassword', gen_salt('bf', 10))
    WHERE username = 'user';


## Deployment

If you want to deploy this software using Docker, please take a look at the
provided `docker-compose.yml` file. It can serve as an example on how to host
Flugbuech. The image is also available [on Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dbrgn/flugbuech/), images are re-built at least
weekly.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to change the `ROCKET_SECRET_KEY` variable when
configuring your deployment!
